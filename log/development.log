Thus, most theorists claim that when individuals are consuming addictive substances like hard drugs or cigarettes, that this is an irrational decision, due to the chemical addiction overpowering their rationality (Shapiro, D., 1994). However, this idea of “perfect decision making” is vastly different to the assumption of “perfect rationality” as perfect decision making does not account for limited cognitive bandwidth (Konnikova, M., 2014), the specific environmental constraints of an individual or time constraints (Jones, O.D., 2000) as well as other factors, which can cause attempted rationality to lead to sub-optimal utility outcomes. In the words of Behavioral Economics Professor Scott Huettel “Traditional rational choice models explain most aspects of decision making but fail in very specific circumstances”\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Literature:\r\nThe crux of the misunderstanding of the decision to use addictive and harmful substances is that it is often seen as a reckless decision made without much forethought, however current evidence shows that most often taking drugs and addictive substances is a form of self-medication (Colder, C.R., 2001). Research published in The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse showed that the majority of hospitalized drug abusers used these drugs as a means to combat symptoms of depression (Weiss, R.D., Griffin, M.L. and Mirin, S.M., 1992). While, The American Journal of Psychiatry even showed strong evidence that the drugs that individuals become addicted to are not chosen at random but relate to the specific “interaction between the psychopharmacologic action of the drug and the dominant painful feelings with which they struggle” (Khantzian, E.J., 1987) further cementing the idea that those addicted to these substances are attempting to self-medicate. \r\n\r\nThere is a large body of research which shows that addiction is more environment related rather than an inevitable repercussion of consuming addictive substances. Bruce Alexanders famous, albeit controversial, “Rat Park” experiment showed strong evidence for the environmental argument of addiction (Alexander, B.K., 2001). For this experiment the scientists created a luxurious habitat for their lab rats to test whether addiction rates would be similar to those found in rats in normal laboratory conditions. This large cage had all the amenities to give the rats a “good” life, including both sexes of rat, entertainment, food and exercise facilities. The cage also had two fluid dispensaries, one containing water and one containing a highly addictive morphine solution, which recorded how much of each the rats consumed. The results supported his hypothesis of environmental factors being more influential than the chemical addictive properties of the drugs, with the normal caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males in one of the experimental conditions and furthermore, the rats in Rat Park only occasionally consuming the morphine laced water and mostly avoided it. Therefore, in the scenario where rats had good enough alternatives to consuming these addictive drugs they would choose to not consume them, therefore if a Rat is capable of making such rational decisions when faced with addiction and suitable alternatives then humans are very likely to be able to act with the same level of rationality.\r\nFurthermore, using a human related example, a large number of veterans returned to America as heroin addicts after the Vietnam War,  however surprisingly a large percentage of these veterans did not remain heroin addicts when they returned, which indicated that the route driver of their addictions was the harsh environment they were in and that once the alternatives of their normal lives were once again available as an option they made the rational choice to stop using one of the most chemically addictive drugs in the world (Waldorf, D. and Biernacki, P., 1979). Therefore, these examples can be extrapolated onto a large portion of the users of addictive substances in modern times as they are likely making a rational decision to escape their lives which they perceive as harder than the risk of the consequences of drug addiction and if they had a good enough set of alternatives they would likely make the rational decision to not consume these substances.\r\n\r\nThe theory of psychological egoism asserts that humans are incapable of making decisions that are not in their own self-interest and thus not capable of acting irrationally (Sober, E., 2000). This is due to the pure fact that even if one intended to act in a self-destructive manner or intended to harm themselves they would be acting in their own best interest by following their own wants and desires and therefore, likely unintentionally, be attempting to maximize their own utility and thus still be acting rationally. This is a debated philosophical concept which was refuted by David Hume when he proposed that  human beings have certain innate non-egoist instincts (Hume, D., 1978), however, supported by others such as Friedrich Nietzsche in his book “Human, all too human” who did not argue against the existence of non-egoistic facets of desires but rather that even when a desire is partly non-egoistic that it is still associated with an egoistic want (Nietzsche, F., 1984). This is a largely debated subject due to the moral repercussions of altruism versus egoism, however the part of this theory that is referred to in this paper is not aimed at the egoistic argument but rather that all actions are inherently made in one's self interest and therefore it describes very well the hypothesized rational nature of human decision making in this paper.\r\n\r\nAll of this evidence suggests that the majority of the individuals addicted to these substances are making a rational decision to attempt to alleviate pain through self-medication and regardless of whether this is a wise choice or not their rational intentions still remain.\r\n\r\n \r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nAlexander, B.K., 2001.

Both a cross sectional and panel data analysis are conducting in this paper to estimate the effect unemployment has on alcohol consumption in South Africa, using a logit model and fixed effect model respectfully. This is done to account for differences that arise due to methodological choices and to assess the effect of a change of employment status. Using different\r\ndefinitions of unemployment this paper estimates that an individual is between 11% and 16% less likely to be a drinker if they are unemployed. Furthermore, this paper estimates that if an individual loses their job, they are between 2% and 3% less likely to become a drinker. This paper goes on to show that there is no statistically significant relationship between whether an individual is unemployed, or if they lose their job, and the number of drinks an individual will consume in a usual drinking session.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Literature\r\nThere is a lack of consensus in the literature when it comes to Unemployment's effect on the consumption of alcohol. There is a plethora of studies that have explored this relationship in many different countries and under a range of different economic conditions, with evidence ranging from unemployment decreasing the consumption of alcohol all the way to unemployment increasing the consumption of alcohol; including many papers showing evidence that unemployment has no effect at all on alcohol consumption. There is relatively strong evidence for the effect of alcohol on unemployment, that alcohol use and abuse can lead to individuals losing their jobs (Jones et al., 1995), however the lack of evidence for the reverse relationship, how unemployment affects the consumption of alcohol, leaves a great opportunity for further research into the subject. Evidence for a Negative Relationship Under classical economic theory it would make sense that unemployment would decrease the consumption of alcohol due to a decrease in disposable income, which relies on the assumption that alcohol is a normal good. The macroeconomic evidence is almost unanimous that alcohol consumption is procyclical at an industry level (Ruhm and Black, 2002; Freeman, 1999; JiménezMartín et al., 2006), leading to a decrease in alcohol consumption when unemployment is increased, which is associated with an economic downturn.\r\nIn line with this theory are various examples of literature that support a decrease in alcohol consumption of alcohol induced by unemployment on the microeconomic level (Townsend, 1979; Warr, 1984; Plant, 1979). Further evidence from Scottish and Norwegian individuals after an unexpected closure of a Danish shipping yard, which resulted in major layoffs, suggested that, when controlling for age, those who became unemployed were more likely to reduce their alcohol consumption than the reemployed workers in the same population (Iversen, L. and Klausen, H., 1986). This may suggest that a hard to control for variable, of whether the loss of jobs is expected or not, may play a role in how the individuals react to the loss of jobs. As well as whether it was a mass loss of jobs, such as an event like this or an economic crisis, or whether it is a specific individual losing a job due to factors relating only to him/her. However, the idea of assessing whether job loss was expected would be extremely difficult to implement without a survey that already asked the individuals questions pertaining to this.\r\nFurthermore, when looking at the participation rate of drinking alcohol, there is strong support of the negative relationship between being a drinker and being unemployed. Holck et al. (1984) showed evidence that women who were unemployed were much less likely to be a drinker and if they were would drink less. This is possibly due to an inability to access alcohol due to a lack of income. Poortinga (2007) supported the theory of lower alcohol consumption participation among\r\nthe unemployed by showing further evidence that those who were working were much more likely to drink that those who were not and that those working in irregular intervals and shifts jobs were\r\nthe most likely to drink. However, even though there is evidence that suggests a lower percentage of drinkers among the unemployed, most research shows that when an individual is unemployed\r\nthey are more prone to problem drinking and alcohol related health problems (Smart, 1979).\r\nAlthough this evidence strongly suggests that increased unemployment leads to decreased consumption of alcohol on the overall scale, due to income effects, this does not take into account the different consumer characteristics of the individuals that can be associated with habit forming good such as alcohol, which may alter how a specific consumer reacts to significant life events. \r\n\r\nConflicting Psychological Evidence \r\nIn order to understand why consumption of alcohol may not adhere to this relationship defined by a normal good under classical economic theory, it is important to understand the psychology behind why different individuals drink. Alcohol consumption is often used as a mood modifier and has been described as having two motivations, a positive reinforcement mechanism when drinking alcohol to induce positive feeling and a negative reinforcement mechanism when used to escape the stresses and negative circumstances in an individual's life (Cox & Klinger, 1988). The former can generally be seen to adhere to the definition of a normal good as the positive feelings associated with drinking are valued less as income is decreased, with more essential goods being focused on more when disposable income is lowered. However, when using alcohol as an escape from the financial and social stresses that arise due to unemployment, individuals may rely more heavily on alcohol and thus value alcohol relatively higher than when they are employed.\r\nThe attempt to alleviate one's stress through inebriation has been seen to be especially prevalent in certain individuals who are not good at coping with stress and thus have a bigger reaction to negative life events, such as losing a job, and therefore rely more heavily on alcohol as a coping mechanism (Greeley & Oei, 1999). This need for stress reduction through drinking is worsenedwhen alternative coping mechanisms are unavailable (Bandura, 1969), which is often the case when employment is lost, as individuals cannot afford alternative support systems. There is strong evidence from multiple studies into this subject that have cemented the idea that many individuals, especially those with alcohol abuse problems, use alcohol as a coping mechanism (Karwacki, Bradley, 1996; Laurent et al., 1992; Pearlin, Randabuugh, 1976). Colder (2001), who also suggested that the use of alcohol as a mechanism to alleviate stress is a significant motivator for\r\nmany individuals, referred to this process as \"self-medication\". \r\n\r\nCrawford et al. (1987) suggested that there was a consensus on the idea that job losses lead to the deterioration in psychological well-being. This in turn suggests that those who use alcohol as a self-medicating tool to manage psychological well-being may rely more heavily on alcohol as they lose their jobs. Hence the idea that a positive relationship between unemployment and alcohol arises.\r\n\r\nEvidence for a Positive Relationship\r\nEvidence illustrating this increase of alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, due to\r\nunemployment has been found in multiple regions such as Finland (Simpura, 1978) and the United\r\nStates (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001).\r\nSupporting this body of evidence is Popovici and French's (2013) research using a two wave panel\r\ndata analysis, with all their results indicating a positive and strong relationship between\r\nunemployment and drinking behaviors among both men and women. They further suggested that\r\nthis result indicated a possible need to be wary of macroeconomic policy decisions which intend\r\nto stimulate the economy during economic downturns possible externalities associated with\r\nalcohol misuse.\r\nOne of the strongest examples of this positive effect came from Weeks and Drengacz (1982)\r\nconducting research into the effects of economic shocks, which lead to unemployment in\r\ncommunities. They used the example of a small town in Oregon where ninety five percent of the\r\ntown’s population were employed by the wood industry in the area, therefore most of the\r\ncommunity would be affected by the same economic shocks. The industry which was sensitive to\r\nnational economic shocks lead to sporadic periods of unemployment, thus creating an ideal setting\r\nto assess the effects unemployment would have on individuals over time. There were three major\r\neconomic shocks that lead to laying off of workers in the period that the study was conducted. The\r\nfirst shock lead to almost six percent of the population of the town losing their jobs \"indefinitely\",\r\nthe second shock resulted in a further six percent losing their jobs two months later and finally the\r\nthird shock, 3 months later, caused an extra one percent of the town to lose their jobs. It was\r\nobserved that each shock was accompanied by an increase in distilled spirits of about 20%,\r\nindicating a strong positive relationship between the higher unemployment and alcohol sales. The\r\nthree replications of the interruptions during this period, through the various economic shocks,\r\nenabled Weeks and Drengacz to conclude that this result was not a product of random chance, but\r\nrather gave a stronger indication of causality.\r\n\r\nThe most notable research into this relationship in the South African context came from Peltzer,\r\net al. (2011) Who conducted research into alcohol use and abuse as part of the South African\r\nNational HIV, Incident, Behavior and Communication(SABSSM) 2008 survey. They showed\r\nevidence that an increase in binge drinking and hazardous drinking prevalence rates were observed\r\nfrom 2005 to 2008 and that lower education and unemployment were found to be associated with\r\nbinge drinking. However, this was just a comparison of the data attained so did not suggest\r\nstatistical significance or causality. This paper will therefore likely be the first statistical analysis\r\ninto the relationship on a microeconomic level in South Africa.\r\nThose who have the biggest health risk when it comes to fluctuations in alcohol consumption,\r\nheavy drinkers (Wechsler et al., 1994), may also be the most affected by the effects of\r\nunemployment. Catalano et al. (1999) showed how this may be true with a study for the American\r\nJournal of Public health where it was concluded that individuals who lost their jobs were seven\r\ntimes more likely to be involved in clinically significant alcohol abuse than individuals who\r\nremained employed. This paper will attempt to account for this by analyzing the effect specifically\r\non binge drinking.\r\nEvidence for No Relationship\r\nAlthough there is evidence for both negative and positive relationships in the literature, there is\r\neven research that suggests that unemployment has no significant effect on consumption at all.\r\nShowing evidence that regardless of employment people drink relatively the same amount due to\r\nan established habit that is significantly income inelastic. Two major studies illustrated the lack of\r\na significant relationship. Plant et al. (1985) showed evidence that, among young men in London,\r\nthe amount that individuals drank was much less if they were unemployed, however they went on\r\nto show that the relationship was not statistically significant, but they did show evidence that the\r\nunemployed men were much more likely to engage in the use of illicit drugs. Similarly, even\r\nthough Cook et al. (1982) showed evidence that young British men who were unemployed were\r\nmore likely to drink heavily, they showed that when controlling for specific characteristics such\r\nas age, education, and social class that there was no statistically significant relationship between\r\nunemployment and alcohol consumption habits. However, both studies were aimed specifically at\r\nyoung men and both only showed results from the European perspective.\r\n\r\nThe Relationship Depends on the Specifics\r\nA few papers have looked at the individual's consumption characteristics, such as level of\r\nconsumption and frequency of consumption, which has been shown to be extremely relevant to\r\nhow the consumer reacts to unemployment.\r\nAn example of how the consumption characteristics of the individual can affect their reaction can\r\nbe seen in Ruhm and Black's study (2002), which was used earlier in this paper as evidence for the\r\nprocyclical nature of alcohol. Although it does suggest overall decreases in expenditure on alcohol,\r\nit also indicated that the changes were predominantly among those who already drank rather than\r\nnew entrants in and exits out of drinking. Furthermore, they observed that in severe economic\r\ndownturns heavy drinkers would actually decrease consumption, likely due to financial\r\nconstraints, while light drinkers would increase consumption, possibly due to increased stress\r\nlevels. This is in contrast with previous evidence that heavy drinkers consume more in financial\r\ncrises (Dávalos et al., 2002), however this result still shows how dependent the reactions of\r\nindividuals are on the specific situations as well as the original consumption habits of the alcohol\r\nconsumer. Even if this does hint at some increases due to economic stress on consumer’s mentality,\r\nthe overall result still showed that any stress induced increase in alcohol consumption was offset\r\nby the decrease resulting from changes in economic factors, such as lower levels of income, on the\r\nmacroeconomic level. This is possibly why the individuals who show a countercyclical behavior\r\ntowards alcohol are \"hidden\" in the statistics, because they are outweighed by the income effect\r\non overall sales.\r\nUnderstanding the Lack of Consensus\r\nThe inconsistency among the evidence could propagate from a large range in differences between\r\nthe countries, economic conditions as well as the way these studies were conducted. It would be\r\ndifficult to realistically assess the differences between the countries at the times of these studies,\r\nhowever Crawford et al. (1987) suggested that confusion in the alcohol-unemployment literature\r\nmay be partly explained by methodological problems, while suggest others suggest circumstantial\r\ndifferences.\r\nThere is also a lack of longitudinal analysis among most of these papers, with the cross-sectional\r\nanalysis holding back any statistical evidence by ignoring the time aspect. This paper will attempt\r\nto remedy this by analyzing the South African data on a longitudinal panel data set so as to better\r\nunderstand how these changes in alcohol consumption occur as well as including the effect that\r\ntime has on these habits. \r\n\r\n\r\n*The empirical analysis section of this paper is available on request.\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Conclusions\r\nIn this paper I deepen the empirical analysis of the effect that unemployment has on the drinking\r\nhabits of an individual using both a cross sectional and panel data analysis so as to account for\r\nvariability that arises due to different estimation methods. This paper illustrates that in the specific\r\nsocio-economic environment in South African that there is a significant negative relationship\r\nbetween unemployment and the choice to be an active drinker. Furthermore, this paper shows a\r\nlack of a significant relationship between unemployment and the number of drinks an individual\r\nwill consume.\r\nUnexpectedly, this shows evidence that suggests that unemployment may not be a risk factor when\r\nit comes to alcohol related health problems in South Africa. Since this paper shows a lack of\r\ncorrelation between the number of drinks an individual will drink and their associated employment\r\nstatus, thus suggesting that alcohol consumption patterns are created by a development of a habit\r\ntowards the drug that is kept regardless of whether the individual is employed or not. This paper\r\ngoes on to show evidence that unemployment, or the loss of one job, will actually decrease the\r\nlikelihood of an individual being an active drinker and thus decrease the likelihood of alcohol use\r\nand abuse.\r\nThe negative relationship illustrated in this paper may be in part due to the structure of South\r\nAfrica’s social support for its unemployed citizens. The extremely high prevalence of\r\nunemployment and poverty in South Africa leads to a lack of financial support to the unemployed\r\nfrom the government, which may explain some of the differences of these results compared to the\r\nliterature. The majority of the literature that showed a positive relationship between unemployment\r\nwere conducted in Europe (Popovici and French, 2013; Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee,\r\nT.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001), which both have extremely good social support for the unemployed\r\nrelative to South Africa. The support these individuals receive could be used to purchase alcohol,\r\nand allow for a maintained alcohol participation and possible increase due to the loss of\r\nresponsibility of work. This is in contrast to the unemployed in South Africa, who barely get\r\nenough social support to stay out of poverty, and often not even enough for that, and thus the\r\nnegative relationship may arise due to an actual inability to afford alcohol as unemployed\r\nindividuals are more likely to be in extreme poverty; unlike more developed countries where a loss\r\nof income from unemployment is buffered by social support, in South Africa the loss of income\r\ncan be complete or at least much more severe.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nBandura, A., (1969).

Both a cross sectional and panel data analysis are conducting in this paper to estimate the effect unemployment has on alcohol consumption in South Africa, using a logit model and fixed effect model respectfully. This is done to account for differences that arise due to methodological choices and to assess the effect of a change of employment status. Using different\r\ndefinitions of unemployment this paper estimates that an individual is between 11% and 16% less likely to be a drinker if they are unemployed. Furthermore, this paper estimates that if an individual loses their job, they are between 2% and 3% less likely to become a drinker. This paper goes on to show that there is no statistically significant relationship between whether an individual is unemployed, or if they lose their job, and the number of drinks an individual will consume in a usual drinking session.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Literature\r\nThere is a lack of consensus in the literature when it comes to Unemployment's effect on the consumption of alcohol. There is a plethora of studies that have explored this relationship in many different countries and under a range of different economic conditions, with evidence ranging from unemployment decreasing the consumption of alcohol all the way to unemployment increasing the consumption of alcohol; including many papers showing evidence that unemployment has no effect at all on alcohol consumption. There is relatively strong evidence for the effect of alcohol on unemployment, that alcohol use and abuse can lead to individuals losing their jobs (Jones et al., 1995), however the lack of evidence for the reverse relationship, how unemployment affects the consumption of alcohol, leaves a great opportunity for further research into the subject. Evidence for a Negative Relationship Under classical economic theory it would make sense that unemployment would decrease the consumption of alcohol due to a decrease in disposable income, which relies on the assumption that alcohol is a normal good. The macroeconomic evidence is almost unanimous that alcohol consumption is procyclical at an industry level (Ruhm and Black, 2002; Freeman, 1999; JiménezMartín et al., 2006), leading to a decrease in alcohol consumption when unemployment is increased, which is associated with an economic downturn.\r\nIn line with this theory are various examples of literature that support a decrease in alcohol consumption of alcohol induced by unemployment on the microeconomic level (Townsend, 1979; Warr, 1984; Plant, 1979). Further evidence from Scottish and Norwegian individuals after an unexpected closure of a Danish shipping yard, which resulted in major layoffs, suggested that, when controlling for age, those who became unemployed were more likely to reduce their alcohol consumption than the reemployed workers in the same population (Iversen, L. and Klausen, H., 1986). This may suggest that a hard to control for variable, of whether the loss of jobs is expected or not, may play a role in how the individuals react to the loss of jobs. As well as whether it was a mass loss of jobs, such as an event like this or an economic crisis, or whether it is a specific individual losing a job due to factors relating only to him/her. However, the idea of assessing whether job loss was expected would be extremely difficult to implement without a survey that already asked the individuals questions pertaining to this.\r\nFurthermore, when looking at the participation rate of drinking alcohol, there is strong support of the negative relationship between being a drinker and being unemployed. Holck et al. (1984) showed evidence that women who were unemployed were much less likely to be a drinker and if they were would drink less. This is possibly due to an inability to access alcohol due to a lack of income. Poortinga (2007) supported the theory of lower alcohol consumption participation among\r\nthe unemployed by showing further evidence that those who were working were much more likely to drink that those who were not and that those working in irregular intervals and shifts jobs were\r\nthe most likely to drink. However, even though there is evidence that suggests a lower percentage of drinkers among the unemployed, most research shows that when an individual is unemployed\r\nthey are more prone to problem drinking and alcohol related health problems (Smart, 1979).\r\nAlthough this evidence strongly suggests that increased unemployment leads to decreased consumption of alcohol on the overall scale, due to income effects, this does not take into account the different consumer characteristics of the individuals that can be associated with habit forming good such as alcohol, which may alter how a specific consumer reacts to significant life events. \r\n\r\nConflicting Psychological Evidence \r\nIn order to understand why consumption of alcohol may not adhere to this relationship defined by a normal good under classical economic theory, it is important to understand the psychology behind why different individuals drink. Alcohol consumption is often used as a mood modifier and has been described as having two motivations, a positive reinforcement mechanism when drinking alcohol to induce positive feeling and a negative reinforcement mechanism when used to escape the stresses and negative circumstances in an individual's life (Cox & Klinger, 1988). The former can generally be seen to adhere to the definition of a normal good as the positive feelings associated with drinking are valued less as income is decreased, with more essential goods being focused on more when disposable income is lowered. However, when using alcohol as an escape from the financial and social stresses that arise due to unemployment, individuals may rely more heavily on alcohol and thus value alcohol relatively higher than when they are employed.\r\nThe attempt to alleviate one's stress through inebriation has been seen to be especially prevalent in certain individuals who are not good at coping with stress and thus have a bigger reaction to negative life events, such as losing a job, and therefore rely more heavily on alcohol as a coping mechanism (Greeley & Oei, 1999). This need for stress reduction through drinking is worsenedwhen alternative coping mechanisms are unavailable (Bandura, 1969), which is often the case when employment is lost, as individuals cannot afford alternative support systems. There is strong evidence from multiple studies into this subject that have cemented the idea that many individuals, especially those with alcohol abuse problems, use alcohol as a coping mechanism (Karwacki, Bradley, 1996; Laurent et al., 1992; Pearlin, Randabuugh, 1976). Colder (2001), who also suggested that the use of alcohol as a mechanism to alleviate stress is a significant motivator for\r\nmany individuals, referred to this process as \"self-medication\". \r\n\r\nCrawford et al. (1987) suggested that there was a consensus on the idea that job losses lead to the deterioration in psychological well-being. This in turn suggests that those who use alcohol as a self-medicating tool to manage psychological well-being may rely more heavily on alcohol as they lose their jobs. Hence the idea that a positive relationship between unemployment and alcohol arises.\r\n\r\nEvidence for a Positive Relationship\r\nEvidence illustrating this increase of alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, due to\r\nunemployment has been found in multiple regions such as Finland (Simpura, 1978) and the United\r\nStates (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001).\r\nSupporting this body of evidence is Popovici and French's (2013) research using a two wave panel\r\ndata analysis, with all their results indicating a positive and strong relationship between\r\nunemployment and drinking behaviors among both men and women. They further suggested that\r\nthis result indicated a possible need to be wary of macroeconomic policy decisions which intend\r\nto stimulate the economy during economic downturns possible externalities associated with\r\nalcohol misuse.\r\nOne of the strongest examples of this positive effect came from Weeks and Drengacz (1982)\r\nconducting research into the effects of economic shocks, which lead to unemployment in\r\ncommunities. They used the example of a small town in Oregon where ninety five percent of the\r\ntown’s population were employed by the wood industry in the area, therefore most of the\r\ncommunity would be affected by the same economic shocks. The industry which was sensitive to\r\nnational economic shocks lead to sporadic periods of unemployment, thus creating an ideal setting\r\nto assess the effects unemployment would have on individuals over time. There were three major\r\neconomic shocks that lead to laying off of workers in the period that the study was conducted. The\r\nfirst shock lead to almost six percent of the population of the town losing their jobs \"indefinitely\",\r\nthe second shock resulted in a further six percent losing their jobs two months later and finally the\r\nthird shock, 3 months later, caused an extra one percent of the town to lose their jobs. It was\r\nobserved that each shock was accompanied by an increase in distilled spirits of about 20%,\r\nindicating a strong positive relationship between the higher unemployment and alcohol sales. The\r\nthree replications of the interruptions during this period, through the various economic shocks,\r\nenabled Weeks and Drengacz to conclude that this result was not a product of random chance, but\r\nrather gave a stronger indication of causality.\r\n\r\nThe most notable research into this relationship in the South African context came from Peltzer,\r\net al. (2011) Who conducted research into alcohol use and abuse as part of the South African\r\nNational HIV, Incident, Behavior and Communication(SABSSM) 2008 survey. They showed\r\nevidence that an increase in binge drinking and hazardous drinking prevalence rates were observed\r\nfrom 2005 to 2008 and that lower education and unemployment were found to be associated with\r\nbinge drinking. However, this was just a comparison of the data attained so did not suggest\r\nstatistical significance or causality. This paper will therefore likely be the first statistical analysis\r\ninto the relationship on a microeconomic level in South Africa.\r\nThose who have the biggest health risk when it comes to fluctuations in alcohol consumption,\r\nheavy drinkers (Wechsler et al., 1994), may also be the most affected by the effects of\r\nunemployment. Catalano et al. (1999) showed how this may be true with a study for the American\r\nJournal of Public health where it was concluded that individuals who lost their jobs were seven\r\ntimes more likely to be involved in clinically significant alcohol abuse than individuals who\r\nremained employed. This paper will attempt to account for this by analyzing the effect specifically\r\non binge drinking.\r\nEvidence for No Relationship\r\nAlthough there is evidence for both negative and positive relationships in the literature, there is\r\neven research that suggests that unemployment has no significant effect on consumption at all.\r\nShowing evidence that regardless of employment people drink relatively the same amount due to\r\nan established habit that is significantly income inelastic. Two major studies illustrated the lack of\r\na significant relationship. Plant et al. (1985) showed evidence that, among young men in London,\r\nthe amount that individuals drank was much less if they were unemployed, however they went on\r\nto show that the relationship was not statistically significant, but they did show evidence that the\r\nunemployed men were much more likely to engage in the use of illicit drugs. Similarly, even\r\nthough Cook et al. (1982) showed evidence that young British men who were unemployed were\r\nmore likely to drink heavily, they showed that when controlling for specific characteristics such\r\nas age, education, and social class that there was no statistically significant relationship between\r\nunemployment and alcohol consumption habits. However, both studies were aimed specifically at\r\nyoung men and both only showed results from the European perspective.\r\n\r\nThe Relationship Depends on the Specifics\r\nA few papers have looked at the individual's consumption characteristics, such as level of\r\nconsumption and frequency of consumption, which has been shown to be extremely relevant to\r\nhow the consumer reacts to unemployment.\r\nAn example of how the consumption characteristics of the individual can affect their reaction can\r\nbe seen in Ruhm and Black's study (2002), which was used earlier in this paper as evidence for the\r\nprocyclical nature of alcohol. Although it does suggest overall decreases in expenditure on alcohol,\r\nit also indicated that the changes were predominantly among those who already drank rather than\r\nnew entrants in and exits out of drinking. Furthermore, they observed that in severe economic\r\ndownturns heavy drinkers would actually decrease consumption, likely due to financial\r\nconstraints, while light drinkers would increase consumption, possibly due to increased stress\r\nlevels. This is in contrast with previous evidence that heavy drinkers consume more in financial\r\ncrises (Dávalos et al., 2002), however this result still shows how dependent the reactions of\r\nindividuals are on the specific situations as well as the original consumption habits of the alcohol\r\nconsumer. Even if this does hint at some increases due to economic stress on consumer’s mentality,\r\nthe overall result still showed that any stress induced increase in alcohol consumption was offset\r\nby the decrease resulting from changes in economic factors, such as lower levels of income, on the\r\nmacroeconomic level. This is possibly why the individuals who show a countercyclical behavior\r\ntowards alcohol are \"hidden\" in the statistics, because they are outweighed by the income effect\r\non overall sales.\r\nUnderstanding the Lack of Consensus\r\nThe inconsistency among the evidence could propagate from a large range in differences between\r\nthe countries, economic conditions as well as the way these studies were conducted. It would be\r\ndifficult to realistically assess the differences between the countries at the times of these studies,\r\nhowever Crawford et al. (1987) suggested that confusion in the alcohol-unemployment literature\r\nmay be partly explained by methodological problems, while suggest others suggest circumstantial\r\ndifferences.\r\nThere is also a lack of longitudinal analysis among most of these papers, with the cross-sectional\r\nanalysis holding back any statistical evidence by ignoring the time aspect. This paper will attempt\r\nto remedy this by analyzing the South African data on a longitudinal panel data set so as to better\r\nunderstand how these changes in alcohol consumption occur as well as including the effect that\r\ntime has on these habits. \r\n\r\n\r\n*The empirical analysis section of this paper is available on request.\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Conclusions\r\nIn this paper I deepen the empirical analysis of the effect that unemployment has on the drinking\r\nhabits of an individual using both a cross sectional and panel data analysis so as to account for\r\nvariability that arises due to different estimation methods. This paper illustrates that in the specific\r\nsocio-economic environment in South African that there is a significant negative relationship\r\nbetween unemployment and the choice to be an active drinker. Furthermore, this paper shows a\r\nlack of a significant relationship between unemployment and the number of drinks an individual\r\nwill consume.\r\nUnexpectedly, this shows evidence that suggests that unemployment may not be a risk factor when\r\nit comes to alcohol related health problems in South Africa. Since this paper shows a lack of\r\ncorrelation between the number of drinks an individual will drink and their associated employment\r\nstatus, thus suggesting that alcohol consumption patterns are created by a development of a habit\r\ntowards the drug that is kept regardless of whether the individual is employed or not. This paper\r\ngoes on to show evidence that unemployment, or the loss of one job, will actually decrease the\r\nlikelihood of an individual being an active drinker and thus decrease the likelihood of alcohol use\r\nand abuse.\r\nThe negative relationship illustrated in this paper may be in part due to the structure of South\r\nAfrica’s social support for its unemployed citizens. The extremely high prevalence of\r\nunemployment and poverty in South Africa leads to a lack of financial support to the unemployed\r\nfrom the government, which may explain some of the differences of these results compared to the\r\nliterature. The majority of the literature that showed a positive relationship between unemployment\r\nwere conducted in Europe (Popovici and French, 2013; Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee,\r\nT.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001), which both have extremely good social support for the unemployed\r\nrelative to South Africa. The support these individuals receive could be used to purchase alcohol,\r\nand allow for a maintained alcohol participation and possible increase due to the loss of\r\nresponsibility of work. This is in contrast to the unemployed in South Africa, who barely get\r\nenough social support to stay out of poverty, and often not even enough for that, and thus the\r\nnegative relationship may arise due to an actual inability to afford alcohol as unemployed\r\nindividuals are more likely to be in extreme poverty; unlike more developed countries where a loss\r\nof income from unemployment is buffered by social support, in South Africa the loss of income\r\ncan be complete or at least much more severe.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nBandura, A., (1969).

Both a cross sectional and panel data analysis are conducting in this paper to estimate the effect unemployment has on alcohol consumption in South Africa, using a logit model and fixed effect model respectfully. This is done to account for differences that arise due to methodological choices and to assess the effect of a change of employment status. Using different\r\ndefinitions of unemployment this paper estimates that an individual is between 11% and 16% less likely to be a drinker if they are unemployed. Furthermore, this paper estimates that if an individual loses their job, they are between 2% and 3% less likely to become a drinker. This paper goes on to show that there is no statistically significant relationship between whether an individual is unemployed, or if they lose their job, and the number of drinks an individual will consume in a usual drinking session.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Literature\r\nThere is a lack of consensus in the literature when it comes to Unemployment's effect on the consumption of alcohol. There is a plethora of studies that have explored this relationship in many different countries and under a range of different economic conditions, with evidence ranging from unemployment decreasing the consumption of alcohol all the way to unemployment increasing the consumption of alcohol; including many papers showing evidence that unemployment has no effect at all on alcohol consumption. There is relatively strong evidence for the effect of alcohol on unemployment, that alcohol use and abuse can lead to individuals losing their jobs (Jones et al., 1995), however the lack of evidence for the reverse relationship, how unemployment affects the consumption of alcohol, leaves a great opportunity for further research into the subject. Evidence for a Negative Relationship Under classical economic theory it would make sense that unemployment would decrease the consumption of alcohol due to a decrease in disposable income, which relies on the assumption that alcohol is a normal good. The macroeconomic evidence is almost unanimous that alcohol consumption is procyclical at an industry level (Ruhm and Black, 2002; Freeman, 1999; JiménezMartín et al., 2006), leading to a decrease in alcohol consumption when unemployment is increased, which is associated with an economic downturn.\r\nIn line with this theory are various examples of literature that support a decrease in alcohol consumption of alcohol induced by unemployment on the microeconomic level (Townsend, 1979; Warr, 1984; Plant, 1979). Further evidence from Scottish and Norwegian individuals after an unexpected closure of a Danish shipping yard, which resulted in major layoffs, suggested that, when controlling for age, those who became unemployed were more likely to reduce their alcohol consumption than the reemployed workers in the same population (Iversen, L. and Klausen, H., 1986). This may suggest that a hard to control for variable, of whether the loss of jobs is expected or not, may play a role in how the individuals react to the loss of jobs. As well as whether it was a mass loss of jobs, such as an event like this or an economic crisis, or whether it is a specific individual losing a job due to factors relating only to him/her. However, the idea of assessing whether job loss was expected would be extremely difficult to implement without a survey that already asked the individuals questions pertaining to this.\r\nFurthermore, when looking at the participation rate of drinking alcohol, there is strong support of the negative relationship between being a drinker and being unemployed. Holck et al. (1984) showed evidence that women who were unemployed were much less likely to be a drinker and if they were would drink less. This is possibly due to an inability to access alcohol due to a lack of income. Poortinga (2007) supported the theory of lower alcohol consumption participation among\r\nthe unemployed by showing further evidence that those who were working were much more likely to drink that those who were not and that those working in irregular intervals and shifts jobs were\r\nthe most likely to drink. However, even though there is evidence that suggests a lower percentage of drinkers among the unemployed, most research shows that when an individual is unemployed\r\nthey are more prone to problem drinking and alcohol related health problems (Smart, 1979).\r\nAlthough this evidence strongly suggests that increased unemployment leads to decreased consumption of alcohol on the overall scale, due to income effects, this does not take into account the different consumer characteristics of the individuals that can be associated with habit forming good such as alcohol, which may alter how a specific consumer reacts to significant life events. \r\n\r\nConflicting Psychological Evidence \r\nIn order to understand why consumption of alcohol may not adhere to this relationship defined by a normal good under classical economic theory, it is important to understand the psychology behind why different individuals drink. Alcohol consumption is often used as a mood modifier and has been described as having two motivations, a positive reinforcement mechanism when drinking alcohol to induce positive feeling and a negative reinforcement mechanism when used to escape the stresses and negative circumstances in an individual's life (Cox & Klinger, 1988). The former can generally be seen to adhere to the definition of a normal good as the positive feelings associated with drinking are valued less as income is decreased, with more essential goods being focused on more when disposable income is lowered. However, when using alcohol as an escape from the financial and social stresses that arise due to unemployment, individuals may rely more heavily on alcohol and thus value alcohol relatively higher than when they are employed.\r\nThe attempt to alleviate one's stress through inebriation has been seen to be especially prevalent in certain individuals who are not good at coping with stress and thus have a bigger reaction to negative life events, such as losing a job, and therefore rely more heavily on alcohol as a coping mechanism (Greeley & Oei, 1999). This need for stress reduction through drinking is worsenedwhen alternative coping mechanisms are unavailable (Bandura, 1969), which is often the case when employment is lost, as individuals cannot afford alternative support systems. There is strong evidence from multiple studies into this subject that have cemented the idea that many individuals, especially those with alcohol abuse problems, use alcohol as a coping mechanism (Karwacki, Bradley, 1996; Laurent et al., 1992; Pearlin, Randabuugh, 1976). Colder (2001), who also suggested that the use of alcohol as a mechanism to alleviate stress is a significant motivator for\r\nmany individuals, referred to this process as \"self-medication\". \r\n\r\nCrawford et al. (1987) suggested that there was a consensus on the idea that job losses lead to the deterioration in psychological well-being. This in turn suggests that those who use alcohol as a self-medicating tool to manage psychological well-being may rely more heavily on alcohol as they lose their jobs. Hence the idea that a positive relationship between unemployment and alcohol arises.\r\n\r\nEvidence for a Positive Relationship\r\nEvidence illustrating this increase of alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, due to unemployment has been found in multiple regions such as Finland (Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001). Supporting this body of evidence is Popovici and French's (2013) research using a two wave panel data analysis, with all their results indicating a positive and strong relationship between unemployment and drinking behaviors among both men and women. They further suggested that this result indicated a possible need to be wary of macroeconomic policy decisions which intend to stimulate the economy during economic downturns possible externalities associated with alcohol misuse. One of the strongest examples of this positive effect came from Weeks and Drengacz (1982) conducting research into the effects of economic shocks, which lead to unemployment in communities. They used the example of a small town in Oregon where ninety five percent of the town’s population were employed by the wood industry in the area, therefore most of the community would be affected by the same economic shocks. The industry which was sensitive to national economic shocks lead to sporadic periods of unemployment, thus creating an ideal setting to assess the effects unemployment would have on individuals over time. There were three major economic shocks that lead to laying off of workers in the period that the study was conducted. The first shock lead to almost six percent of the population of the town losing their jobs \"indefinitely\", the second shock resulted in a further six percent losing their jobs two months later and finally the third shock, 3 months later, caused an extra one percent of the town to lose their jobs. It was observed that each shock was accompanied by an increase in distilled spirits of about 20%, indicating a strong positive relationship between the higher unemployment and alcohol sales. The three replications of the interruptions during this period, through the various economic shocks, enabled Weeks and Drengacz to conclude that this result was not a product of random chance, but rather gave a stronger indication of causality.\r\n\r\nThe most notable research into this relationship in the South African context came from Peltzer,\r\net al. (2011) Who conducted research into alcohol use and abuse as part of the South African\r\nNational HIV, Incident, Behavior and Communication(SABSSM) 2008 survey. They showed\r\nevidence that an increase in binge drinking and hazardous drinking prevalence rates were observed\r\nfrom 2005 to 2008 and that lower education and unemployment were found to be associated with\r\nbinge drinking. However, this was just a comparison of the data attained so did not suggest\r\nstatistical significance or causality. This paper will therefore likely be the first statistical analysis\r\ninto the relationship on a microeconomic level in South Africa.\r\nThose who have the biggest health risk when it comes to fluctuations in alcohol consumption,\r\nheavy drinkers (Wechsler et al., 1994), may also be the most affected by the effects of\r\nunemployment. Catalano et al. (1999) showed how this may be true with a study for the American\r\nJournal of Public health where it was concluded that individuals who lost their jobs were seven\r\ntimes more likely to be involved in clinically significant alcohol abuse than individuals who\r\nremained employed. This paper will attempt to account for this by analyzing the effect specifically\r\non binge drinking.\r\nEvidence for No Relationship\r\nAlthough there is evidence for both negative and positive relationships in the literature, there is\r\neven research that suggests that unemployment has no significant effect on consumption at all.\r\nShowing evidence that regardless of employment people drink relatively the same amount due to\r\nan established habit that is significantly income inelastic. Two major studies illustrated the lack of\r\na significant relationship. Plant et al. (1985) showed evidence that, among young men in London,\r\nthe amount that individuals drank was much less if they were unemployed, however they went on\r\nto show that the relationship was not statistically significant, but they did show evidence that the\r\nunemployed men were much more likely to engage in the use of illicit drugs. Similarly, even\r\nthough Cook et al. (1982) showed evidence that young British men who were unemployed were\r\nmore likely to drink heavily, they showed that when controlling for specific characteristics such\r\nas age, education, and social class that there was no statistically significant relationship between\r\nunemployment and alcohol consumption habits. However, both studies were aimed specifically at\r\nyoung men and both only showed results from the European perspective.\r\n\r\nThe Relationship Depends on the Specifics\r\nA few papers have looked at the individual's consumption characteristics, such as level of\r\nconsumption and frequency of consumption, which has been shown to be extremely relevant to\r\nhow the consumer reacts to unemployment.\r\nAn example of how the consumption characteristics of the individual can affect their reaction can\r\nbe seen in Ruhm and Black's study (2002), which was used earlier in this paper as evidence for the\r\nprocyclical nature of alcohol. Although it does suggest overall decreases in expenditure on alcohol,\r\nit also indicated that the changes were predominantly among those who already drank rather than\r\nnew entrants in and exits out of drinking. Furthermore, they observed that in severe economic\r\ndownturns heavy drinkers would actually decrease consumption, likely due to financial\r\nconstraints, while light drinkers would increase consumption, possibly due to increased stress\r\nlevels. This is in contrast with previous evidence that heavy drinkers consume more in financial\r\ncrises (Dávalos et al., 2002), however this result still shows how dependent the reactions of\r\nindividuals are on the specific situations as well as the original consumption habits of the alcohol\r\nconsumer. Even if this does hint at some increases due to economic stress on consumer’s mentality,\r\nthe overall result still showed that any stress induced increase in alcohol consumption was offset\r\nby the decrease resulting from changes in economic factors, such as lower levels of income, on the\r\nmacroeconomic level. This is possibly why the individuals who show a countercyclical behavior\r\ntowards alcohol are \"hidden\" in the statistics, because they are outweighed by the income effect\r\non overall sales.\r\nUnderstanding the Lack of Consensus\r\nThe inconsistency among the evidence could propagate from a large range in differences between\r\nthe countries, economic conditions as well as the way these studies were conducted. It would be\r\ndifficult to realistically assess the differences between the countries at the times of these studies,\r\nhowever Crawford et al. (1987) suggested that confusion in the alcohol-unemployment literature\r\nmay be partly explained by methodological problems, while suggest others suggest circumstantial\r\ndifferences.\r\nThere is also a lack of longitudinal analysis among most of these papers, with the cross-sectional\r\nanalysis holding back any statistical evidence by ignoring the time aspect. This paper will attempt\r\nto remedy this by analyzing the South African data on a longitudinal panel data set so as to better\r\nunderstand how these changes in alcohol consumption occur as well as including the effect that\r\ntime has on these habits. \r\n\r\n\r\n*The empirical analysis section of this paper is available on request.\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Conclusions\r\nIn this paper I deepen the empirical analysis of the effect that unemployment has on the drinking\r\nhabits of an individual using both a cross sectional and panel data analysis so as to account for\r\nvariability that arises due to different estimation methods. This paper illustrates that in the specific\r\nsocio-economic environment in South African that there is a significant negative relationship\r\nbetween unemployment and the choice to be an active drinker. Furthermore, this paper shows a\r\nlack of a significant relationship between unemployment and the number of drinks an individual\r\nwill consume.\r\nUnexpectedly, this shows evidence that suggests that unemployment may not be a risk factor when\r\nit comes to alcohol related health problems in South Africa. Since this paper shows a lack of\r\ncorrelation between the number of drinks an individual will drink and their associated employment\r\nstatus, thus suggesting that alcohol consumption patterns are created by a development of a habit\r\ntowards the drug that is kept regardless of whether the individual is employed or not. This paper\r\ngoes on to show evidence that unemployment, or the loss of one job, will actually decrease the\r\nlikelihood of an individual being an active drinker and thus decrease the likelihood of alcohol use\r\nand abuse.\r\nThe negative relationship illustrated in this paper may be in part due to the structure of South\r\nAfrica’s social support for its unemployed citizens. The extremely high prevalence of\r\nunemployment and poverty in South Africa leads to a lack of financial support to the unemployed\r\nfrom the government, which may explain some of the differences of these results compared to the\r\nliterature. The majority of the literature that showed a positive relationship between unemployment\r\nwere conducted in Europe (Popovici and French, 2013; Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee,\r\nT.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001), which both have extremely good social support for the unemployed\r\nrelative to South Africa. The support these individuals receive could be used to purchase alcohol,\r\nand allow for a maintained alcohol participation and possible increase due to the loss of\r\nresponsibility of work. This is in contrast to the unemployed in South Africa, who barely get\r\nenough social support to stay out of poverty, and often not even enough for that, and thus the\r\nnegative relationship may arise due to an actual inability to afford alcohol as unemployed\r\nindividuals are more likely to be in extreme poverty; unlike more developed countries where a loss\r\nof income from unemployment is buffered by social support, in South Africa the loss of income\r\ncan be complete or at least much more severe.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nBandura, A., (1969).

The macroeconomic evidence is almost unanimous that alcohol consumption is procyclical at an industry level (Ruhm and Black, 2002; Freeman, 1999; JiménezMartín et al., 2006), leading to a decrease in alcohol consumption when unemployment is increased, which is associated with an economic downturn.\r\nIn line with this theory are various examples of literature that support a decrease in alcohol consumption of alcohol induced by unemployment on the microeconomic level (Townsend, 1979; Warr, 1984; Plant, 1979). Further evidence from Scottish and Norwegian individuals after an unexpected closure of a Danish shipping yard, which resulted in major layoffs, suggested that, when controlling for age, those who became unemployed were more likely to reduce their alcohol consumption than the reemployed workers in the same population (Iversen, L. and Klausen, H., 1986). This may suggest that a hard to control for variable, of whether the loss of jobs is expected or not, may play a role in how the individuals react to the loss of jobs. As well as whether it was a mass loss of jobs, such as an event like this or an economic crisis, or whether it is a specific individual losing a job due to factors relating only to him/her. However, the idea of assessing whether job loss was expected would be extremely difficult to implement without a survey that already asked the individuals questions pertaining to this.\r\nFurthermore, when looking at the participation rate of drinking alcohol, there is strong support of the negative relationship between being a drinker and being unemployed. Holck et al. (1984) showed evidence that women who were unemployed were much less likely to be a drinker and if they were would drink less. This is possibly due to an inability to access alcohol due to a lack of income. Poortinga (2007) supported the theory of lower alcohol consumption participation among\r\nthe unemployed by showing further evidence that those who were working were much more likely to drink that those who were not and that those working in irregular intervals and shifts jobs were\r\nthe most likely to drink. However, even though there is evidence that suggests a lower percentage of drinkers among the unemployed, most research shows that when an individual is unemployed\r\nthey are more prone to problem drinking and alcohol related health problems (Smart, 1979).\r\nAlthough this evidence strongly suggests that increased unemployment leads to decreased consumption of alcohol on the overall scale, due to income effects, this does not take into account the different consumer characteristics of the individuals that can be associated with habit forming good such as alcohol, which may alter how a specific consumer reacts to significant life events. \r\n\r\nConflicting Psychological Evidence \r\nIn order to understand why consumption of alcohol may not adhere to this relationship defined by a normal good under classical economic theory, it is important to understand the psychology behind why different individuals drink. Alcohol consumption is often used as a mood modifier and has been described as having two motivations, a positive reinforcement mechanism when drinking alcohol to induce positive feeling and a negative reinforcement mechanism when used to escape the stresses and negative circumstances in an individual's life (Cox & Klinger, 1988). The former can generally be seen to adhere to the definition of a normal good as the positive feelings associated with drinking are valued less as income is decreased, with more essential goods being focused on more when disposable income is lowered. However, when using alcohol as an escape from the financial and social stresses that arise due to unemployment, individuals may rely more heavily on alcohol and thus value alcohol relatively higher than when they are employed.\r\nThe attempt to alleviate one's stress through inebriation has been seen to be especially prevalent in certain individuals who are not good at coping with stress and thus have a bigger reaction to negative life events, such as losing a job, and therefore rely more heavily on alcohol as a coping mechanism (Greeley & Oei, 1999). This need for stress reduction through drinking is worsenedwhen alternative coping mechanisms are unavailable (Bandura, 1969), which is often the case when employment is lost, as individuals cannot afford alternative support systems. There is strong evidence from multiple studies into this subject that have cemented the idea that many individuals, especially those with alcohol abuse problems, use alcohol as a coping mechanism (Karwacki, Bradley, 1996; Laurent et al., 1992; Pearlin, Randabuugh, 1976). Colder (2001), who also suggested that the use of alcohol as a mechanism to alleviate stress is a significant motivator for\r\nmany individuals, referred to this process as \"self-medication\". \r\n\r\nCrawford et al. (1987) suggested that there was a consensus on the idea that job losses lead to the deterioration in psychological well-being. This in turn suggests that those who use alcohol as a self-medicating tool to manage psychological well-being may rely more heavily on alcohol as they lose their jobs. Hence the idea that a positive relationship between unemployment and alcohol arises.\r\n\r\nEvidence for a Positive Relationship\r\nEvidence illustrating this increase of alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, due to unemployment has been found in multiple regions such as Finland (Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001). Supporting this body of evidence is Popovici and French's (2013) research using a two wave panel data analysis, with all their results indicating a positive and strong relationship between unemployment and drinking behaviors among both men and women. They further suggested that this result indicated a possible need to be wary of macroeconomic policy decisions which intend to stimulate the economy during economic downturns possible externalities associated with alcohol misuse. One of the strongest examples of this positive effect came from Weeks and Drengacz (1982) conducting research into the effects of economic shocks, which lead to unemployment in communities. They used the example of a small town in Oregon where ninety five percent of the town’s population were employed by the wood industry in the area, therefore most of the community would be affected by the same economic shocks. The industry which was sensitive to national economic shocks lead to sporadic periods of unemployment, thus creating an ideal setting to assess the effects unemployment would have on individuals over time. There were three major economic shocks that lead to laying off of workers in the period that the study was conducted. The first shock lead to almost six percent of the population of the town losing their jobs \"indefinitely\", the second shock resulted in a further six percent losing their jobs two months later and finally the third shock, 3 months later, caused an extra one percent of the town to lose their jobs. It was observed that each shock was accompanied by an increase in distilled spirits of about 20%, indicating a strong positive relationship between the higher unemployment and alcohol sales. The three replications of the interruptions during this period, through the various economic shocks, enabled Weeks and Drengacz to conclude that this result was not a product of random chance, but rather gave a stronger indication of causality.\r\n\r\nThe most notable research into this relationship in the South African context came from Peltzer,\r\net al. (2011) Who conducted research into alcohol use and abuse as part of the South African\r\nNational HIV, Incident, Behavior and Communication(SABSSM) 2008 survey. They showed\r\nevidence that an increase in binge drinking and hazardous drinking prevalence rates were observed\r\nfrom 2005 to 2008 and that lower education and unemployment were found to be associated with\r\nbinge drinking. However, this was just a comparison of the data attained so did not suggest\r\nstatistical significance or causality. This paper will therefore likely be the first statistical analysis\r\ninto the relationship on a microeconomic level in South Africa.\r\nThose who have the biggest health risk when it comes to fluctuations in alcohol consumption,\r\nheavy drinkers (Wechsler et al., 1994), may also be the most affected by the effects of\r\nunemployment. Catalano et al. (1999) showed how this may be true with a study for the American\r\nJournal of Public health where it was concluded that individuals who lost their jobs were seven\r\ntimes more likely to be involved in clinically significant alcohol abuse than individuals who\r\nremained employed. This paper will attempt to account for this by analyzing the effect specifically\r\non binge drinking.\r\nEvidence for No Relationship\r\nAlthough there is evidence for both negative and positive relationships in the literature, there is\r\neven research that suggests that unemployment has no significant effect on consumption at all.\r\nShowing evidence that regardless of employment people drink relatively the same amount due to\r\nan established habit that is significantly income inelastic. Two major studies illustrated the lack of\r\na significant relationship. Plant et al. (1985) showed evidence that, among young men in London,\r\nthe amount that individuals drank was much less if they were unemployed, however they went on\r\nto show that the relationship was not statistically significant, but they did show evidence that the\r\nunemployed men were much more likely to engage in the use of illicit drugs. Similarly, even\r\nthough Cook et al. (1982) showed evidence that young British men who were unemployed were\r\nmore likely to drink heavily, they showed that when controlling for specific characteristics such\r\nas age, education, and social class that there was no statistically significant relationship between\r\nunemployment and alcohol consumption habits. However, both studies were aimed specifically at\r\nyoung men and both only showed results from the European perspective.\r\n\r\nThe Relationship Depends on the Specifics\r\nA few papers have looked at the individual's consumption characteristics, such as level of\r\nconsumption and frequency of consumption, which has been shown to be extremely relevant to\r\nhow the consumer reacts to unemployment.\r\nAn example of how the consumption characteristics of the individual can affect their reaction can\r\nbe seen in Ruhm and Black's study (2002), which was used earlier in this paper as evidence for the\r\nprocyclical nature of alcohol. Although it does suggest overall decreases in expenditure on alcohol,\r\nit also indicated that the changes were predominantly among those who already drank rather than\r\nnew entrants in and exits out of drinking. Furthermore, they observed that in severe economic\r\ndownturns heavy drinkers would actually decrease consumption, likely due to financial\r\nconstraints, while light drinkers would increase consumption, possibly due to increased stress\r\nlevels. This is in contrast with previous evidence that heavy drinkers consume more in financial\r\ncrises (Dávalos et al., 2002), however this result still shows how dependent the reactions of\r\nindividuals are on the specific situations as well as the original consumption habits of the alcohol\r\nconsumer. Even if this does hint at some increases due to economic stress on consumer’s mentality,\r\nthe overall result still showed that any stress induced increase in alcohol consumption was offset\r\nby the decrease resulting from changes in economic factors, such as lower levels of income, on the\r\nmacroeconomic level. This is possibly why the individuals who show a countercyclical behavior\r\ntowards alcohol are \"hidden\" in the statistics, because they are outweighed by the income effect\r\non overall sales.\r\nUnderstanding the Lack of Consensus\r\nThe inconsistency among the evidence could propagate from a large range in differences between\r\nthe countries, economic conditions as well as the way these studies were conducted. It would be\r\ndifficult to realistically assess the differences between the countries at the times of these studies,\r\nhowever Crawford et al. (1987) suggested that confusion in the alcohol-unemployment literature\r\nmay be partly explained by methodological problems, while suggest others suggest circumstantial\r\ndifferences.\r\nThere is also a lack of longitudinal analysis among most of these papers, with the cross-sectional\r\nanalysis holding back any statistical evidence by ignoring the time aspect. This paper will attempt\r\nto remedy this by analyzing the South African data on a longitudinal panel data set so as to better\r\nunderstand how these changes in alcohol consumption occur as well as including the effect that\r\ntime has on these habits. \r\n\r\n\r\n*The empirical analysis section of this paper is available on request.\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Conclusions\r\nIn this paper I deepen the empirical analysis of the effect that unemployment has on the drinking\r\nhabits of an individual using both a cross sectional and panel data analysis so as to account for\r\nvariability that arises due to different estimation methods. This paper illustrates that in the specific\r\nsocio-economic environment in South African that there is a significant negative relationship\r\nbetween unemployment and the choice to be an active drinker. Furthermore, this paper shows a\r\nlack of a significant relationship between unemployment and the number of drinks an individual\r\nwill consume.\r\nUnexpectedly, this shows evidence that suggests that unemployment may not be a risk factor when\r\nit comes to alcohol related health problems in South Africa. Since this paper shows a lack of\r\ncorrelation between the number of drinks an individual will drink and their associated employment\r\nstatus, thus suggesting that alcohol consumption patterns are created by a development of a habit\r\ntowards the drug that is kept regardless of whether the individual is employed or not. This paper\r\ngoes on to show evidence that unemployment, or the loss of one job, will actually decrease the\r\nlikelihood of an individual being an active drinker and thus decrease the likelihood of alcohol use\r\nand abuse.\r\nThe negative relationship illustrated in this paper may be in part due to the structure of South\r\nAfrica’s social support for its unemployed citizens. The extremely high prevalence of\r\nunemployment and poverty in South Africa leads to a lack of financial support to the unemployed\r\nfrom the government, which may explain some of the differences of these results compared to the\r\nliterature. The majority of the literature that showed a positive relationship between unemployment\r\nwere conducted in Europe (Popovici and French, 2013; Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee,\r\nT.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001), which both have extremely good social support for the unemployed\r\nrelative to South Africa. The support these individuals receive could be used to purchase alcohol,\r\nand allow for a maintained alcohol participation and possible increase due to the loss of\r\nresponsibility of work. This is in contrast to the unemployed in South Africa, who barely get\r\nenough social support to stay out of poverty, and often not even enough for that, and thus the\r\nnegative relationship may arise due to an actual inability to afford alcohol as unemployed\r\nindividuals are more likely to be in extreme poverty; unlike more developed countries where a loss\r\nof income from unemployment is buffered by social support, in South Africa the loss of income\r\ncan be complete or at least much more severe.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nBandura, A., (1969).

Both a cross sectional and panel data analysis are conducting in this paper to estimate the effect unemployment has on alcohol consumption in South Africa, using a logit model and fixed effect model respectfully. This is done to account for differences that arise due to methodological choices and to assess the effect of a change of employment status. Using different definitions of unemployment this paper estimates that an individual is between 11% and 16% less likely to be a drinker if they are unemployed. Furthermore, this paper estimates that if an individual loses their job, they are between 2% and 3% less likely to become a drinker. This paper goes on to show that there is no statistically significant relationship between whether an individual is unemployed, or if they lose their job, and the number of drinks an individual will consume in a usual drinking session.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Literature\r\nThere is a lack of consensus in the literature when it comes to Unemployment's effect on the consumption of alcohol. There is a plethora of studies that have explored this relationship in many different countries and under a range of different economic conditions, with evidence ranging from unemployment decreasing the consumption of alcohol all the way to unemployment increasing the consumption of alcohol; including many papers showing evidence that unemployment has no effect at all on alcohol consumption. There is relatively strong evidence for the effect of alcohol on unemployment, that alcohol use and abuse can lead to individuals losing their jobs (Jones et al., 1995), however the lack of evidence for the reverse relationship, how unemployment affects the consumption of alcohol, leaves a great opportunity for further research into the subject. Evidence for a Negative Relationship Under classical economic theory it would make sense that unemployment would decrease the consumption of alcohol due to a decrease in disposable income, which relies on the assumption that alcohol is a normal good. The macroeconomic evidence is almost unanimous that alcohol consumption is procyclical at an industry level (Ruhm and Black, 2002; Freeman, 1999; JiménezMartín et al., 2006), leading to a decrease in alcohol consumption when unemployment is increased, which is associated with an economic downturn.\r\nIn line with this theory are various examples of literature that support a decrease in alcohol consumption of alcohol induced by unemployment on the microeconomic level (Townsend, 1979; Warr, 1984; Plant, 1979). Further evidence from Scottish and Norwegian individuals after an unexpected closure of a Danish shipping yard, which resulted in major layoffs, suggested that, when controlling for age, those who became unemployed were more likely to reduce their alcohol consumption than the reemployed workers in the same population (Iversen, L. and Klausen, H., 1986). This may suggest that a hard to control for variable, of whether the loss of jobs is expected or not, may play a role in how the individuals react to the loss of jobs. As well as whether it was a mass loss of jobs, such as an event like this or an economic crisis, or whether it is a specific individual losing a job due to factors relating only to him/her. However, the idea of assessing whether job loss was expected would be extremely difficult to implement without a survey that already asked the individuals questions pertaining to this.\r\nFurthermore, when looking at the participation rate of drinking alcohol, there is strong support of the negative relationship between being a drinker and being unemployed. Holck et al. (1984) showed evidence that women who were unemployed were much less likely to be a drinker and if they were would drink less. This is possibly due to an inability to access alcohol due to a lack of income. Poortinga (2007) supported the theory of lower alcohol consumption participation among the unemployed by showing further evidence that those who were working were much more likely to drink that those who were not and that those working in irregular intervals and shifts jobs were the most likely to drink. However, even though there is evidence that suggests a lower percentage of drinkers among the unemployed, most research shows that when an individual is unemployed they are more prone to problem drinking and alcohol related health problems (Smart, 1979).\r\nAlthough this evidence strongly suggests that increased unemployment leads to decreased consumption of alcohol on the overall scale, due to income effects, this does not take into account the different consumer characteristics of the individuals that can be associated with habit forming good such as alcohol, which may alter how a specific consumer reacts to significant life events. \r\n\r\nConflicting Psychological Evidence \r\nIn order to understand why consumption of alcohol may not adhere to this relationship defined by a normal good under classical economic theory, it is important to understand the psychology behind why different individuals drink. Alcohol consumption is often used as a mood modifier and has been described as having two motivations, a positive reinforcement mechanism when drinking alcohol to induce positive feeling and a negative reinforcement mechanism when used to escape the stresses and negative circumstances in an individual's life (Cox & Klinger, 1988). The former can generally be seen to adhere to the definition of a normal good as the positive feelings associated with drinking are valued less as income is decreased, with more essential goods being focused on more when disposable income is lowered. However, when using alcohol as an escape from the financial and social stresses that arise due to unemployment, individuals may rely more heavily on alcohol and thus value alcohol relatively higher than when they are employed.\r\nThe attempt to alleviate one's stress through inebriation has been seen to be especially prevalent in certain individuals who are not good at coping with stress and thus have a bigger reaction to negative life events, such as losing a job, and therefore rely more heavily on alcohol as a coping mechanism (Greeley & Oei, 1999). This need for stress reduction through drinking is worsened when alternative coping mechanisms are unavailable (Bandura, 1969), which is often the case when employment is lost, as individuals cannot afford alternative support systems. There is strong evidence from multiple studies into this subject that have cemented the idea that many individuals, especially those with alcohol abuse problems, use alcohol as a coping mechanism (Karwacki, Bradley, 1996; Laurent et al., 1992; Pearlin, Randabuugh, 1976). Colder (2001), who also suggested that the use of alcohol as a mechanism to alleviate stress is a significant motivator for many individuals, referred to this process as \"self-medication\". \r\n\r\nCrawford et al. (1987) suggested that there was a consensus on the idea that job losses lead to the deterioration in psychological well-being. This in turn suggests that those who use alcohol as a self-medicating tool to manage psychological well-being may rely more heavily on alcohol as they lose their jobs. Hence the idea that a positive relationship between unemployment and alcohol arises.\r\n\r\nEvidence for a Positive Relationship\r\nEvidence illustrating this increase of alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, due to unemployment has been found in multiple regions such as Finland (Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001). Supporting this body of evidence is Popovici and French's (2013) research using a two wave panel data analysis, with all their results indicating a positive and strong relationship between unemployment and drinking behaviors among both men and women. They further suggested that this result indicated a possible need to be wary of macroeconomic policy decisions which intend to stimulate the economy during economic downturns possible externalities associated with alcohol misuse. One of the strongest examples of this positive effect came from Weeks and Drengacz (1982) conducting research into the effects of economic shocks, which lead to unemployment in communities. They used the example of a small town in Oregon where ninety five percent of the town’s population were employed by the wood industry in the area, therefore most of the community would be affected by the same economic shocks. The industry which was sensitive to national economic shocks lead to sporadic periods of unemployment, thus creating an ideal setting to assess the effects unemployment would have on individuals over time. There were three major economic shocks that lead to laying off of workers in the period that the study was conducted. The first shock lead to almost six percent of the population of the town losing their jobs \"indefinitely\", the second shock resulted in a further six percent losing their jobs two months later and finally the third shock, 3 months later, caused an extra one percent of the town to lose their jobs. It was observed that each shock was accompanied by an increase in distilled spirits of about 20%, indicating a strong positive relationship between the higher unemployment and alcohol sales. The three replications of the interruptions during this period, through the various economic shocks, enabled Weeks and Drengacz to conclude that this result was not a product of random chance, but rather gave a stronger indication of causality.\r\n\r\nThe most notable research into this relationship in the South African context came from Peltzer, et al. (2011) Who conducted research into alcohol use and abuse as part of the South African National HIV, Incident, Behavior and Communication(SABSSM) 2008 survey. They showed evidence that an increase in binge drinking and hazardous drinking prevalence rates were observed from 2005 to 2008 and that lower education and unemployment were found to be associated with binge drinking. However, this was just a comparison of the data attained so did not suggest statistical significance or causality. This paper will therefore likely be the first statistical analysis into the relationship on a microeconomic level in South Africa. Those who have the biggest health risk when it comes to fluctuations in alcohol consumption, heavy drinkers (Wechsler et al., 1994), may also be the most affected by the effects of unemployment. Catalano et al. (1999) showed how this may be true with a study for the American Journal of Public health where it was concluded that individuals who lost their jobs were seven times more likely to be involved in clinically significant alcohol abuse than individuals who remained employed. This paper will attempt to account for this by analyzing the effect specifically on binge drinking.\r\n\r\nEvidence for No Relationship\r\nAlthough there is evidence for both negative and positive relationships in the literature, there is even research that suggests that unemployment has no significant effect on consumption at all. Showing evidence that regardless of employment people drink relatively the same amount due to an established habit that is significantly income inelastic. Two major studies illustrated the lack of a significant relationship. Plant et al. (1985) showed evidence that, among young men in London, the amount that individuals drank was much less if they were unemployed, however they went on to show that the relationship was not statistically significant, but they did show evidence that the unemployed men were much more likely to engage in the use of illicit drugs. Similarly, even though Cook et al. (1982) showed evidence that young British men who were unemployed were more likely to drink heavily, they showed that when controlling for specific characteristics such as age, education, and social class that there was no statistically significant relationship between unemployment and alcohol consumption habits. However, both studies were aimed specifically at young men and both only showed results from the European perspective.\r\n\r\nThe Relationship Depends on the Specifics\r\nA few papers have looked at the individual's consumption characteristics, such as level of consumption and frequency of consumption, which has been shown to be extremely relevant to how the consumer reacts to unemployment.\r\nAn example of how the consumption characteristics of the individual can affect their reaction can be seen in Ruhm and Black's study (2002), which was used earlier in this paper as evidence for the procyclical nature of alcohol. Although it does suggest overall decreases in expenditure on alcohol, it also indicated that the changes were predominantly among those who already drank rather than new entrants in and exits out of drinking. Furthermore, they observed that in severe economic downturns heavy drinkers would actually decrease consumption, likely due to financial constraints, while light drinkers would increase consumption, possibly due to increased stress levels. This is in contrast with previous evidence that heavy drinkers consume more in financial crises (Dávalos et al., 2002), however this result still shows how dependent the reactions of individuals are on the specific situations as well as the original consumption habits of the alcohol consumer. Even if this does hint at some increases due to economic stress on consumer’s mentality, the overall result still showed that any stress induced increase in alcohol consumption was offset by the decrease resulting from changes in economic factors, such as lower levels of income, on the macroeconomic level. This is possibly why the individuals who show a countercyclical behavior towards alcohol are \"hidden\" in the statistics, because they are outweighed by the income effect on overall sales.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the Lack of Consensus\r\nThe inconsistency among the evidence could propagate from a large range in differences between the countries, economic conditions as well as the way these studies were conducted. It would be difficult to realistically assess the differences between the countries at the times of these studies, however Crawford et al. (1987) suggested that confusion in the alcohol-unemployment literature may be partly explained by methodological problems, while suggest others suggest circumstantial differences. There is also a lack of longitudinal analysis among most of these papers, with the cross-sectional analysis holding back any statistical evidence by ignoring the time aspect. This paper will attempt to remedy this by analyzing the South African data on a longitudinal panel data set so as to better understand how these changes in alcohol consumption occur as well as including the effect that time has on these habits. \r\n\r\n\r\n*The empirical analysis section of this paper is available on request.\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Conclusions\r\nThis paper deepens the empirical analysis of the effect that unemployment has on the drinking habits of an individual using both a cross sectional and panel data analysis so as to account for variability that arises due to different estimation methods. This paper illustrates that in the specific socio-economic environment in South African that there is a significant negative relationship between unemployment and the choice to be an active drinker. Furthermore, this paper shows a lack of a significant relationship between unemployment and the number of drinks an individual will consume.\r\nUnexpectedly, this shows evidence that suggests that unemployment may not be a risk factor when it comes to alcohol related health problems in South Africa. Since this paper shows a lack of correlation between the number of drinks an individual will drink and their associated employment status, thus suggesting that alcohol consumption patterns are created by a development of a habit towards the drug that is kept regardless of whether the individual is employed or not. This paper goes on to show evidence that unemployment, or the loss of one job, will actually decrease the likelihood of an individual being an active drinker and thus decrease the likelihood of alcohol use and abuse.\r\nThe negative relationship illustrated in this paper may be in part due to the structure of South Africa’s social support for its unemployed citizens. The extremely high prevalence of unemployment and poverty in South Africa leads to a lack of financial support to the unemployed from the government, which may explain some of the differences of these results compared to the literature. The majority of the literature that showed a positive relationship between unemployment were conducted in Europe (Popovici and French, 2013; Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001), which both have extremely good social support for the unemployed relative to South Africa. The support these individuals receive could be used to purchase alcohol, and allow for a maintained alcohol participation and possible increase due to the loss of responsibility of work. This is in contrast to the unemployed in South Africa, who barely get enough social support to stay out of poverty, and often not even enough for that, and thus the negative relationship may arise due to an actual inability to afford alcohol as unemployed individuals are more likely to be in extreme poverty; unlike more developed countries where a loss of income from unemployment is buffered by social support, in South Africa the loss of income can be complete or at least much more severe.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nBandura, A., (1969).

Both a cross sectional and panel data analysis are conducting in this paper to estimate the effect unemployment has on alcohol consumption in South Africa, using a logit model and fixed effect model respectfully. This is done to account for differences that arise due to methodological choices and to assess the effect of a change of employment status. Using different definitions of unemployment this paper estimates that an individual is between 11% and 16% less likely to be a drinker if they are unemployed. Furthermore, this paper estimates that if an individual loses their job, they are between 2% and 3% less likely to become a drinker. This paper goes on to show that there is no statistically significant relationship between whether an individual is unemployed, or if they lose their job, and the number of drinks an individual will consume in a usual drinking session.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Literature\r\nThere is a lack of consensus in the literature when it comes to Unemployment's effect on the consumption of alcohol. There is a plethora of studies that have explored this relationship in many different countries and under a range of different economic conditions, with evidence ranging from unemployment decreasing the consumption of alcohol all the way to unemployment increasing the consumption of alcohol; including many papers showing evidence that unemployment has no effect at all on alcohol consumption. There is relatively strong evidence for the effect of alcohol on unemployment, that alcohol use and abuse can lead to individuals losing their jobs (Jones et al., 1995), however the lack of evidence for the reverse relationship, how unemployment affects the consumption of alcohol, leaves a great opportunity for further research into the subject. Evidence for a Negative Relationship Under classical economic theory it would make sense that unemployment would decrease the consumption of alcohol due to a decrease in disposable income, which relies on the assumption that alcohol is a normal good. The macroeconomic evidence is almost unanimous that alcohol consumption is procyclical at an industry level (Ruhm and Black, 2002; Freeman, 1999; JiménezMartín et al., 2006), leading to a decrease in alcohol consumption when unemployment is increased, which is associated with an economic downturn.\r\nIn line with this theory are various examples of literature that support a decrease in alcohol consumption of alcohol induced by unemployment on the microeconomic level (Townsend, 1979; Warr, 1984; Plant, 1979). Further evidence from Scottish and Norwegian individuals after an unexpected closure of a Danish shipping yard, which resulted in major layoffs, suggested that, when controlling for age, those who became unemployed were more likely to reduce their alcohol consumption than the reemployed workers in the same population (Iversen, L. and Klausen, H., 1986). This may suggest that a hard to control for variable, of whether the loss of jobs is expected or not, may play a role in how the individuals react to the loss of jobs. As well as whether it was a mass loss of jobs, such as an event like this or an economic crisis, or whether it is a specific individual losing a job due to factors relating only to him/her. However, the idea of assessing whether job loss was expected would be extremely difficult to implement without a survey that already asked the individuals questions pertaining to this.\r\nFurthermore, when looking at the participation rate of drinking alcohol, there is strong support of the negative relationship between being a drinker and being unemployed. Holck et al. (1984) showed evidence that women who were unemployed were much less likely to be a drinker and if they were would drink less. This is possibly due to an inability to access alcohol due to a lack of income. Poortinga (2007) supported the theory of lower alcohol consumption participation among the unemployed by showing further evidence that those who were working were much more likely to drink that those who were not and that those working in irregular intervals and shifts jobs were the most likely to drink. However, even though there is evidence that suggests a lower percentage of drinkers among the unemployed, most research shows that when an individual is unemployed they are more prone to problem drinking and alcohol related health problems (Smart, 1979).\r\nAlthough this evidence strongly suggests that increased unemployment leads to decreased consumption of alcohol on the overall scale, due to income effects, this does not take into account the different consumer characteristics of the individuals that can be associated with habit forming good such as alcohol, which may alter how a specific consumer reacts to significant life events. \r\n\r\nConflicting Psychological Evidence \r\nIn order to understand why consumption of alcohol may not adhere to this relationship defined by a normal good under classical economic theory, it is important to understand the psychology behind why different individuals drink. Alcohol consumption is often used as a mood modifier and has been described as having two motivations, a positive reinforcement mechanism when drinking alcohol to induce positive feeling and a negative reinforcement mechanism when used to escape the stresses and negative circumstances in an individual's life (Cox & Klinger, 1988). The former can generally be seen to adhere to the definition of a normal good as the positive feelings associated with drinking are valued less as income is decreased, with more essential goods being focused on more when disposable income is lowered. However, when using alcohol as an escape from the financial and social stresses that arise due to unemployment, individuals may rely more heavily on alcohol and thus value alcohol relatively higher than when they are employed.\r\nThe attempt to alleviate one's stress through inebriation has been seen to be especially prevalent in certain individuals who are not good at coping with stress and thus have a bigger reaction to negative life events, such as losing a job, and therefore rely more heavily on alcohol as a coping mechanism (Greeley & Oei, 1999). This need for stress reduction through drinking is worsened when alternative coping mechanisms are unavailable (Bandura, 1969), which is often the case when employment is lost, as individuals cannot afford alternative support systems. There is strong evidence from multiple studies into this subject that have cemented the idea that many individuals, especially those with alcohol abuse problems, use alcohol as a coping mechanism (Karwacki, Bradley, 1996; Laurent et al., 1992; Pearlin, Randabuugh, 1976). Colder (2001), who also suggested that the use of alcohol as a mechanism to alleviate stress is a significant motivator for many individuals, referred to this process as \"self-medication\". \r\n\r\nCrawford et al. (1987) suggested that there was a consensus on the idea that job losses lead to the deterioration in psychological well-being. This in turn suggests that those who use alcohol as a self-medicating tool to manage psychological well-being may rely more heavily on alcohol as they lose their jobs. Hence the idea that a positive relationship between unemployment and alcohol arises.\r\n\r\nEvidence for a Positive Relationship\r\nEvidence illustrating this increase of alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, due to unemployment has been found in multiple regions such as Finland (Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001). Supporting this body of evidence is Popovici and French's (2013) research using a two wave panel data analysis, with all their results indicating a positive and strong relationship between unemployment and drinking behaviors among both men and women. They further suggested that this result indicated a possible need to be wary of macroeconomic policy decisions which intend to stimulate the economy during economic downturns possible externalities associated with alcohol misuse. One of the strongest examples of this positive effect came from Weeks and Drengacz (1982) conducting research into the effects of economic shocks, which lead to unemployment in communities. They used the example of a small town in Oregon where ninety five percent of the town’s population were employed by the wood industry in the area, therefore most of the community would be affected by the same economic shocks. The industry which was sensitive to national economic shocks lead to sporadic periods of unemployment, thus creating an ideal setting to assess the effects unemployment would have on individuals over time. There were three major economic shocks that lead to laying off of workers in the period that the study was conducted. The first shock lead to almost six percent of the population of the town losing their jobs \"indefinitely\", the second shock resulted in a further six percent losing their jobs two months later and finally the third shock, 3 months later, caused an extra one percent of the town to lose their jobs. It was observed that each shock was accompanied by an increase in distilled spirits of about 20%, indicating a strong positive relationship between the higher unemployment and alcohol sales. The three replications of the interruptions during this period, through the various economic shocks, enabled Weeks and Drengacz to conclude that this result was not a product of random chance, but rather gave a stronger indication of causality.\r\n\r\nThe most notable research into this relationship in the South African context came from Peltzer, et al. (2011) Who conducted research into alcohol use and abuse as part of the South African National HIV, Incident, Behavior and Communication(SABSSM) 2008 survey. They showed evidence that an increase in binge drinking and hazardous drinking prevalence rates were observed from 2005 to 2008 and that lower education and unemployment were found to be associated with binge drinking. However, this was just a comparison of the data attained so did not suggest statistical significance or causality. This paper will therefore likely be the first statistical analysis into the relationship on a microeconomic level in South Africa. Those who have the biggest health risk when it comes to fluctuations in alcohol consumption, heavy drinkers (Wechsler et al., 1994), may also be the most affected by the effects of unemployment. Catalano et al. (1999) showed how this may be true with a study for the American Journal of Public health where it was concluded that individuals who lost their jobs were seven times more likely to be involved in clinically significant alcohol abuse than individuals who remained employed. This paper will attempt to account for this by analyzing the effect specifically on binge drinking.\r\n\r\nEvidence for No Relationship\r\nAlthough there is evidence for both negative and positive relationships in the literature, there is even research that suggests that unemployment has no significant effect on consumption at all. Showing evidence that regardless of employment people drink relatively the same amount due to an established habit that is significantly income inelastic. Two major studies illustrated the lack of a significant relationship. Plant et al. (1985) showed evidence that, among young men in London, the amount that individuals drank was much less if they were unemployed, however they went on to show that the relationship was not statistically significant, but they did show evidence that the unemployed men were much more likely to engage in the use of illicit drugs. Similarly, even though Cook et al. (1982) showed evidence that young British men who were unemployed were more likely to drink heavily, they showed that when controlling for specific characteristics such as age, education, and social class that there was no statistically significant relationship between unemployment and alcohol consumption habits. However, both studies were aimed specifically at young men and both only showed results from the European perspective.\r\n\r\nThe Relationship Depends on the Specifics\r\nA few papers have looked at the individual's consumption characteristics, such as level of consumption and frequency of consumption, which has been shown to be extremely relevant to how the consumer reacts to unemployment.\r\nAn example of how the consumption characteristics of the individual can affect their reaction can be seen in Ruhm and Black's study (2002), which was used earlier in this paper as evidence for the procyclical nature of alcohol. Although it does suggest overall decreases in expenditure on alcohol, it also indicated that the changes were predominantly among those who already drank rather than new entrants in and exits out of drinking. Furthermore, they observed that in severe economic downturns heavy drinkers would actually decrease consumption, likely due to financial constraints, while light drinkers would increase consumption, possibly due to increased stress levels. This is in contrast with previous evidence that heavy drinkers consume more in financial crises (Dávalos et al., 2002), however this result still shows how dependent the reactions of individuals are on the specific situations as well as the original consumption habits of the alcohol consumer. Even if this does hint at some increases due to economic stress on consumer’s mentality, the overall result still showed that any stress induced increase in alcohol consumption was offset by the decrease resulting from changes in economic factors, such as lower levels of income, on the macroeconomic level. This is possibly why the individuals who show a countercyclical behavior towards alcohol are \"hidden\" in the statistics, because they are outweighed by the income effect on overall sales.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the Lack of Consensus\r\nThe inconsistency among the evidence could propagate from a large range in differences between the countries, economic conditions as well as the way these studies were conducted. It would be difficult to realistically assess the differences between the countries at the times of these studies, however Crawford et al. (1987) suggested that confusion in the alcohol-unemployment literature may be partly explained by methodological problems, while suggest others suggest circumstantial differences. There is also a lack of longitudinal analysis among most of these papers, with the cross-sectional analysis holding back any statistical evidence by ignoring the time aspect. This paper will attempt to remedy this by analyzing the South African data on a longitudinal panel data set so as to better understand how these changes in alcohol consumption occur as well as including the effect that time has on these habits. \r\n\r\n\r\n*The empirical analysis section of this paper is available on request.\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Conclusions\r\nThis paper deepens the empirical analysis of the effect that unemployment has on the drinking habits of an individual using both a cross sectional and panel data analysis so as to account for variability that arises due to different estimation methods. This paper illustrates that in the specific socio-economic environment in South African that there is a significant negative relationship between unemployment and the choice to be an active drinker. Furthermore, this paper shows a lack of a significant relationship between unemployment and the number of drinks an individual will consume.\r\nUnexpectedly, this shows evidence that suggests that unemployment may not be a risk factor when it comes to alcohol related health problems in South Africa. Since this paper shows a lack of correlation between the number of drinks an individual will drink and their associated employment status, thus suggesting that alcohol consumption patterns are created by a development of a habit towards the drug that is kept regardless of whether the individual is employed or not. This paper goes on to show evidence that unemployment, or the loss of one job, will actually decrease the likelihood of an individual being an active drinker and thus decrease the likelihood of alcohol use and abuse.\r\nThe negative relationship illustrated in this paper may be in part due to the structure of South Africa’s social support for its unemployed citizens. The extremely high prevalence of unemployment and poverty in South Africa leads to a lack of financial support to the unemployed from the government, which may explain some of the differences of these results compared to the literature. The majority of the literature that showed a positive relationship between unemployment were conducted in Europe (Popovici and French, 2013; Simpura, 1978) and the United States (Dee, T.S., 2001; SAMHSA, 2001), which both have extremely good social support for the unemployed relative to South Africa. The support these individuals receive could be used to purchase alcohol, and allow for a maintained alcohol participation and possible increase due to the loss of responsibility of work. This is in contrast to the unemployed in South Africa, who barely get enough social support to stay out of poverty, and often not even enough for that, and thus the negative relationship may arise due to an actual inability to afford alcohol as unemployed individuals are more likely to be in extreme poverty; unlike more developed countries where a loss of income from unemployment is buffered by social support, in South Africa the loss of income can be complete or at least much more severe.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nBandura, A., (1969).
